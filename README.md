# battlecats-decryptor

**Usage:**
- import the project into an IDE (eg. IntelliJ)
- put the game assets from the BattleCats apk in a folder called `input` in the projects root directory
- run Main.java
- decrypted assets will be in a new folder called `output`

note: im probably not going to update this anymore since I don't (and never played) Battle Cats myself, but you are free to use the code reference or whatever else you want.
